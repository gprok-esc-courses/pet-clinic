# Pet Clinic example
## for Intro to SW class - Fall 2023

## Scenario: 

You are hired to build the software for a pet clinic.   
The clinic has secretaries, a manager, and veterinarians.   
The secretaries add appointments to the system for people who want treatments for their pets. Each new pet is given a unique number id, and the system should store its name, species, breed, and year of birth. An appointment contains the petâ€™s id, the date and time of the appointment, and the reason for the visit.  
Doctors must be able to view their open appointments. Upon appointment completion, the doctor adds to the system the results and any treatment required.  
The manager wants to export the history of a pet into a csv file, to view treatments on a specific day, and to manage (add/remove) secretaries and veterinarians.
